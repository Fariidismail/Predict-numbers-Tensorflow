Guessing of numbers
number 0 --- I give "0" result, because it is only one circle;
number 1 --- I give "7" result, may be both have 1 straight line;
number 2 --- i give "4" result
number 3 --- I give "3" result, because number is 2;
number 4 --- I give "2" result
number 5 --- I give "2" result
number 6 --- I give "0" result, i think that both have circle;
number 7 --- I give "3" result
number 8 --- I give "2" result
number 9 --- I give "2" result
I dont know why most numbers look like 2;
